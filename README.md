# InsightFace-REST

InsightFace REST API for easy deployment of face recognition services using NVIDIA's TensorRT.
Code is heavily based on API [code](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/python-package)
in official DeepInsight InsightFace [repository](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface). 

This repository provides source code for building face recognition REST API
and converting models to ONNX and TensorRT using Docker.


## List of supported models:
### Detection:
  - retinaface_r50_v1 (from official package)
  - retinaface_mnet025_v1 (from official package)
  - retinaface_mnet025_v2 (from official package)
  - [mnet_cov2](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/detection/RetinaFaceAntiCov) (must be manually downloaded and unpacked to models dir)
  - [centerface](https://github.com/Star-Clouds/CenterFace) (from Star-Clouds CenterFace repository)


### Recognition:
  - arcface_r100_v1 (from official package)
  - r100-arcface-msfdrop75 ([SubCenter ArcFace R100](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/SubCenter-ArcFace), must be manually downloaded and unpacked to models dir)


## Prerequesites:

1. Docker
2. Nvidia-container-toolkit
3. Nvidia GPU drivers (450.x.x and above)


## Run with Docker:

1. Clone repo.
2. Execute `deploy_trt.sh` from repo's root.
3. Go to http://localhost:18081 to access documentation and try API

If you have multiple GPU's with enough GPU memory you can try running multiple containers by
editing *n_gpu* and *n_workers* parameters in `deploy_trt.sh`.

> For pure MXNet based version, without TensorRT support you can check
> depreciated [v0.5.0](https://github.com/SthPhoenix/InsightFace-REST/tree/v0.5.0)
> branch

### `/extract` endpoint


Extract endpoint accepts list of images and return faces bounding boxes with corresponding 
embeddings.

API accept JSON in following format:
```
{
  "images":{
      "data":[
          base64_encoded_image1,  
          base64_encoded_image2
      ]
  },
  "max_size":[640,480]
}
```

Where `max_size` is maximum image dimension, images with dimensions greater than `max_size`
will be downsized to provided value.

If `max_size` is set to **0**, image won't be resized.

To call API from Python you can use following sample code:

```python
import os
import json
import base64
import requests

def file2base64(path):
    with open(path, mode='rb') as fl:
        encoded = base64.b64encode(fl.read()).decode('ascii')
        return encoded


def extract_vecs(ims,max_size=[640,480]):
    target = [file2base64(im) for im in ims]
    req = {"images": {"data": target},"max_size":max_size}
    resp = requests.post('http://localhost:18081/extract', json=req)
    data = resp.json()
    return data
    
images_path = 'src/api/test_images'
images = os.path.listdir(images_path)
data = extract_vecs(images)

```
Response is in following format:

```json
[
    [
        {"vec": [0.322431242,0.53545632,], "det": 0, "prob": 0.999, "bbox": [100,100,200,200]},
        {"vec": [0.235334567,-0.2342546,], "det": 1, "prob": 0.998, "bbox": [200,200,300,300]},
    ],
    [
        {"vec": [0.322431242,0.53545632,], "det": 0, "prob": 0.999, "bbox": [100,100,200,200]},
        {"vec": [0.235334567,-0.2342546,], "det": 1, "prob": 0.998, "bbox": [200,200,300,300]},
    ]
]
```
First level is list in order the images were sent, second level are faces detected per each image as 
dictionary containing face embedding, bounding box, detection probability and detection number.  


## Work in progress:
- Add Triton Inference Server as execution backend
- Add Cython postprocessing of Retinaface predictions.


## Known issues:
- Building TensorRT engine with batch inference is currently not supported for
  TensorRT Docker images above 20.09 tag, due to bug in BatchNorm layers
  parsing in TRT version >= 7.2.

## Changelist:

### 2020-12-06

REST-API:
- Added draft support for batch inference of ArcFace model.

Conversion scripts:
- Added draft support for batch inference of ArcFace model.



### 2020-11-20

REST API:
- Pure MXNet version removed from master branch.
- Added models bootstrapping before running workers, to prevent race condition for building TRT engine.
- Applied changes from conversion scripts (see below)

Conversion scripts:
- Reshape ONNX models in memory to prevent writing temp files.
- TRT engine builder now takes input name and shape, required for building
  optimization profiles, from ONNX model intself.

### 2020-11-07

Conversion scripts:
- Added support for building TensorRT engine with batch input.
- Added support for RetinaFaceAntiCov model (mnet_cov2, must be manually
  [downloaded](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/detection/RetinaFaceAntiCov)
  and unpacked to `models/mxnet/mnet_cov2`)

REST API:
- Added support for RetinaFaceAntiCov v2
- Added support for FP16 precision (`force_fp16` flag in `deploy_trt.sh`)

### 2020-10-22
Conversion scripts:
- Minor refactoring

REST API:
- Added TensorRT version in `src/api_trt`
- Added Dockerfile (`src/Dockerfile_trt`)
- Added deployment script `deploy_trt.sh`
- Added Centerface detector

TensorRT version contains MXNet and ONNXRuntime compiled for CPU
for testing and conversion purposes.

### 2020-10-16
Conversion scripts:
- Added conversion of MXNet models to ONNX using Python
- Added conversion of ONNX to TensorRT using Python
- Added demo inference scripts for ArcFace and Retinaface using ONNX
and TensorRT backends

REST API:
- no changes

### 2020-09-28
- REST API code refactored to FastAPI
- Detection/Recognition code is now based on official Insightface Python package.
- TensorFlow MTCNN replaced with PyTorch version
- Added RetinaFace detector
- Added InsightFace gender/age detector
- Added support for GPU inference
- Resize function refactored for fixed image proportions (significant speed increase and memory usage optimization)
